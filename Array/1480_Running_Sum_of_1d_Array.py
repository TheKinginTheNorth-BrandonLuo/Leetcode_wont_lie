1480. Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

    def runningSum(self, nums):
        return [sum(nums[:i + 1]) for i in range(len(nums))]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[i] += nums[i - 1]
            
        return nums
